# Finally, we want to open a web browser to view the HTML "report" we
# just created. Here we use the helper command "see" (available on
# most Debian based distros) to open the default viewer for the filetype
# (HTML). The command "open" achieves the same thing on other platforms.
# On Windows, you can ommit the helper command and just "execute" the
# $filename (i.e. `$filename`) and Windows will open the default viewer
# (browser) for that filetype.
#
# You can also specify a particular browser if you want,
# e.g. `firefox $filename`.
