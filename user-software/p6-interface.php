# We want to enable tab-completion of commands, which allows the user to

# readline_completion_function) that will provide an array of possible
# functions names. This can be based on the $partial characters the user
# has typed or the point in the program we are at, or any other
# factors we want. In our case, we'll simply provide an array of ALL of
# the valid commands we have.

# We call readline with a string that forms the command prompt. In our
# case we'll put the date & time in there to show that we can change
# it each time its called. Whatever the user enters is returned. This
# one simple line implements most of the readline magic. At this stage
# the user can take advantage of tab-completion, history (use up/down
# cursor keys) and so on.

# We need to manually add commands to the history. This is used for
# the command history that the user accesses with the up/down cursor

# intermediate input, for example) if we want, although we'll add
# everything our users enter in this example.

# If we want to programmatically retrieve the history, we can use a

# for licensing and other reasons. So we will keep a parallel copy of
# the history in an array for programatic access.
